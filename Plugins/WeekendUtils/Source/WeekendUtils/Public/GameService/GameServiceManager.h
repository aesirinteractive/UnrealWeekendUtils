/**
 * Mastermind behind running and maintaining game services.
 * Service classes and their desired instance classes can be registered here. Provides API to start and shutdown services,
 * while ensuring that dependencies of started services are started first, so services can always access their dependent
 * services without valid checking them.
 *
 * Although this managers lifetime exceeds the lifetime of a @UWorld, the lifetime of created services is always bound to
 * that of the world they have been started in. This requires a cooperation with @UWorldGameServiceRunner.
 *
 * See @UGameServiceConfig for how to register service classes manually and @UGameModeServiceConfigBase to automatically
 * register configured services based on the current worlds @AGameMode.
 *
 * Services are configured by UClass, which is also used for accessing the service from service users. Service classes can
 * either be derived from @UGameServiceBase or any @UInterface.
 * Configured service instance classes MUST be derived from @UGameServiceBase, but if they are registered under an interface,
 * they must also implement that interface.
 *
 * @remark It is strongly recommended to access services by deriving from @FGameServieUser and using its inherited utilities
 * instead of accessing the service manager directly.
